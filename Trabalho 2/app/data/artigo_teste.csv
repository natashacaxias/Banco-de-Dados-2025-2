WE Marsh, T Hantel, C Zetzsche - 3D User Interfaces ( , 2013 - ieeexplore.ieee.org. ABSTRACT Virtual reality systems provide a convenient means of studying human cognition  and performance on a wide range of tasks for which real-world testing is cost prohibitive or  difficult to control. For the results of such studies to be valid, it is important to ensure that  .."
